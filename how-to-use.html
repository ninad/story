    <h1 id="what">What is a Story Map?</h1>

    <p>
        A User Story Map is a powerful visual tool to capture how people use your product.
        It arranges user stories into a map to help teams understand their users' needs and to guide product releases. The map is typically organized horizontally by user activities and vertically by priority, offering a holistic view of the product's functionality.</p>

    <h1 id="history">A Brief History</h1>  

    <p>
        Jeff Patton introduced User Story Mapping in 2005, gaining traction with his 2014 book. 
        The method is a standard in Agile and UX/UI fields. It helps teams visually organize user stories, 
        prioritize features, and facilitate communication. The goal is to align product development with user 
        needs and business objectives.
    </p>

    <h1 id="how">How to use storymap.site?</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="https://storymap.site">storymap.site</a> is designed to use plain text input to quickly draw the map. 
        I love using story maps, but haven't found a simple tool where one can type out indented bullets to generate the map.
    </p>

    <p>Using story map is really simple.</p>

<pre>
<code>Root level items draw ACTIVITY cards
* First bullet draws STEP cards 
** Second bullet draws STORY cards
* Here is another STEP under our activity  
** Here is another STORY
** One more STORY
** Last STORY
This is another ACTIVITY
* Another STEP
** And another STORY
** you get the drift?</code>
</pre>

    <p>I like to space things out the use emojis too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<pre><code>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Persona: James, a busy professional
üöò Activity: Order a ride 

* Step: Open app
** Story: Log in to my account
** üü¢ Story: Log in with face-id

* Step: Request a ride 
** Story: Set pickup location
** Story: Select ride type (UberX, UberPool etc.)
** üü¢ Story: See ETA for each ride type
** Story: Set destination

* Step: Track driver
** Story: See driver's name, photo, vehicle details
** Story: View real-time location of driver on map
** üü¢ Story: Get notified when driver is late

* Step: Take ride
** üü¢ Story: Get notified when driver arrives
** Story: Rate driver and provide feedback after trip</code></pre>

    <p>
        You can get creative and use emojis to communicate various things, 
        like key steps, frustration points for the user, or even tag releases or priority.

    <h1 id="guide">Create your first story map</h1>

    <h3>Step 1: Assemble the Team</h3>
    <p>Gather everyone who will contribute to the product: designers, developers, product owners, and other stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Identify User Personas</h3>  
    <p>Know who your users are, what their goals are, and what problems they face.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Define the User Journey</h3>
    <p>
        Identify the key activities or steps that users take while interacting with the product. 
        Place these horizontally on the map.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Brainstorm User Stories</h3>
    <p>
        For each activity, list out the associated user stories. 
        These are specific tasks users will complete. Place these under the corresponding activities.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prioritize Stories</h3>  
    <p>
        Rank the stories vertically based on priority. 
        Critical functionalities should be at the top.
