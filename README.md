# What are Story Maps?
A User Story Map is a visual tool used in Agile development to capture the user journey through a product. It arranges user stories into a map to help teams understand their users' needs and to guide product releases. The map is typically organized horizontally by user activities and vertically by priority, offering a holistic view of the product's functionality.

# A Brief History
Jeff Patton introduced User Story Mapping in 2005, gaining traction with his 2014 book. The method is a standard in Agile and UX/UI fields. It helps teams visually organize user stories, prioritize features, and facilitate communication. The goal is to align product development with user needs and business objectives.

Story map is designed to use plain text input to quickly draw the map. It is less gimmicky with drag drop postit notes. I love using story maps, but haven't found a simple tool where I can just type out indented bullets to generate the map. 

Using story map is really simple. 
```
Root level items draw ACTIVITY cards
* First bullet draws STEP cards
** Second bullet draws STORY cards
* Here is another STEP under our activity
** Here is another STORY
** One more STORY
** Last STORY
This is another ACTIVITY
* Another STEP
** And another STORY
** you get the drift?
```
I like to space things out the use emojis too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: 
```
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Persona: James, a busy professional
üöò Activity: Order a ride

* Step: Open app
** Story: Log in to my account
** üü¢ Story: Log in with face-id

* Step: Request a ride
** Story: Set pickup location
** Story: Select ride type (UberX, UberPool etc.)
** üü¢ Story: See ETA for each ride type
** Story: Set destination

* Step: Track driver
** Story: See driver's name, photo, vehicle details
** Story: View real-time location of driver on map
** üü¢ Story: Get notified when driver is late

* Step: Take ride
** üü¢ Story: Get notified when driver arrives
** Story: Rate driver and provide feedback after trip
```
You can get creative and use emojis to communicate various things, like key steps, frustration points for the user, or even tag releases or priority.
